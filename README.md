#Ready Player Tic-Tac-Toe

My first project for WDI course.  I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my version of a tic tac toe game.  Currently a work in progress, as I want to add more features.

I learned how to use transition to make the flashing border for the winning player (garish, I know, but design is obviously not my strong suit yet), using opacity in RGBA color values to make the background of the reset button opaque.  Also had a friend show me how to do text-shadow.

Still to Come:
I want to add a feature where Player One can choose to be X or O
I want to add scores for each player to keep track of how many games they have won each session.
Change the sizing on the background image to include the entire pic even at full screen.
